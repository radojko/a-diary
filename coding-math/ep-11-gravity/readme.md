# Gravity

Gravity pulling things in a "Downward" direction is only really an idea brought upon by us living on Earth.

Perception:
```
       up
        |
        |
↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ | ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓  (gravity)
        |  sky
--------|-------- X
        |  earth
        |
        |
        |
        Y
      down
```

Reality:

```
We live on a sphere. Gravity is pulling us towards the center of the earth.
```

Also, the further you get from the earth. The less that gravity has a hold on you.

We understand this as:
```
Inversely Proportional to the Square of the Distance
```

In other words:

```
If your distance from the center of the earth Doubled.
The force of gravity you would experience would Reduce By Four.
```

Also, keep in mind that earth is not the only thing with Gravity.

Anthing that has a `Mass` exerts some gravity on those things within its thrawl.
The Force of that gravity just depends on the mass.

The bigger a thing is, the more gravity it exerts on other things.

The smaller a thing is, the less gravity it exerts on other things.

> Fact: The moon is about 1/6th that of earth's gravity.
> 180lbs on Earth
> 30lbs on the Moon
> 450lbs on Jupiter

## Math Zone

Gravity = (G * M) / r<sup>2</sup>

- G = Gravitation Constant
  - In Reality:
    - G = `6.672` * `10`<sup>-8</sup> cm <sup>-3</sup> * g <sup>-1</sup> * s<sup>-2</sup>
  - For us:
    - G = M / r<sup>2</sup>
- M = Mass of the object doing the pulling (eg Earth)
- r = distance between the Centers of these objects.
