Talking about `cos`

It looks similar to sin wave, but:
  - it deals with the `adjacent` `side` and the `opposite` `side`.
  - it is `out of phase` with sin by 90 degrees.

Talking about `tan`

It is generally not use very often as it has the possibility of returning the values `undefined` as well as `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.

There was mention of `atan()` but nothing detailed.
