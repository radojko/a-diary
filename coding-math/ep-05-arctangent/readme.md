# Arctangent

Tangent is a bit of an outcast.

There is a function related to the Tangent called Arctangent.

- An `Arctangent`
  - `Math.atan()`
  - is the inverse of a tangent.

There are also inverses of `cos` and `sin` in the form of `acos` and `asin`

These inversed versions of our function friends are sometimes noted with a `-1` superscript:

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>sin<sup>-1</sup></li>
    <li>cos<sup>-1</sup></li>
    <li>tan<sup>-1</sup></li>
  </ul>
<div>

## How these work:

| sin()           | asin()           |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| `sin(30) = 0.5` | `asin(0.5) = 30` |

## Why Arctangent is so cool

You can use it to point things at other things.

## Note about canvas Transformations:

You should `Translate` before you `Rotate`

## Atan vs Atan2

Same sort of things, but `atan2(y,x)` takes the `Y` and `X` values seperately while `atan(angle)` just takes an angle in radians. The Atan2 is better at rotating things correctly. See Arrow code.
