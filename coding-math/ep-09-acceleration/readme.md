# Acceleration
## A change in Velocity over time.

- Acceleration
  - is a `Vector`
  - there are different meanings to Accelearation depending on the context.
    - every day brainspace:
      - we say something `accelerates` as it `speeds up`
        - A car `accelerates`,
          - gas pedal = `accelerator`
    - math brainspace:
      - Acceleration is a change in Velocity over time
        - that change could be to `Increase` and also `Decrease` that Velocity.
          - again, handles `speeding up` and `slowing down`
        - Also handles changing of `direction`

Let's talk about units

- Acceleration uses
  - `Distance` per `time` per `time`

- Gravity is also a kind of Acceleration.
  - Real Earth Gravity:
    - 32 feet per second per second.
    - 32 feet/sec<sup>2<sup>

# Integration

## Euler Method

Add Acceleration to Velocity and then Velocity to Position

`Position += Velocity += Acceleration`

"Euler" is pronounced "Oil-er"

There are other methods that will be taught later.
